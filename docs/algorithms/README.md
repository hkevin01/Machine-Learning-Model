# Machine Learning Algorithms

This documentation provides detailed information about the machine learning algorithms implemented in this project.

## Algorithm Categories

### Supervised Learning
Algorithms that learn from labeled training data to predict outcomes on unseen data.

- [Decision Trees](supervised/decision_trees.md) - Tree-based models that split data based on feature values
- [Random Forest](supervised/random_forest.md) - Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness
- [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](supervised/svm.md) - Models that find the optimal hyperplane to separate classes
- [XGBoost](supervised/xgboost.md) - Gradient boosting optimized for speed and performance

### Unsupervised Learning
Algorithms that find patterns in data without explicit labels.

- [K-means Clustering](unsupervised/kmeans.md) - Partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity
- [DBSCAN](unsupervised/dbscan.md) - Density-based clustering that identifies clusters of arbitrary shape
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](unsupervised/pca.md) - Dimensionality reduction technique

### Semi-Supervised Learning
Algorithms that use both labeled and unlabeled data for training.

- [Label Propagation](semi_supervised/label_propagation.md) - Propagates labels from labeled to unlabeled instances
- [Semi-Supervised SVM](semi_supervised/semi_supervised_svm.md) - SVM variant utilizing unlabeled data

## General Workflow

Our machine learning implementation follows this standard workflow:

1. **Collect Labeled Data**: Gather and organize data with known outcomes/labels
2. **Clean & Preprocess**: Handle missing values, normalize, encode categorical features
3. **Select Algorithm**: Choose appropriate model based on problem type and data characteristics
4. **Train Model**: Fit the model to training data
5. **Validate Performance**: Evaluate using metrics appropriate to the problem domain
6. **Tune Hyperparameters**: Optimize model parameters to improve performance
7. **Predict on New Data**: Apply the trained model to make predictions
8. **Monitor & Update**: Track model performance and retrain as needed

## Implementation Details

All algorithm implementations follow a consistent interface with these methods:
- `fit(X, y)`: Train the model
- `predict(X)`: Make predictions on new data
- `evaluate(X, y)`: Assess model performance

See specific algorithm documentation for algorithm-specific methods and parameters.
