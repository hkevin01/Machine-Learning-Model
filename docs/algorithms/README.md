# Machine Learning Algorithms

This directory contains documentation for all machine learning algorithms implemented in this project.

## Algorithm Categories

- [**Supervised Learning**](supervised/) - Algorithms that learn from labeled data
  - [Decision Trees](supervised/decision_trees.md) - Tree-based classification and regression
  - [Random Forest](supervised/random_forest.md) - Ensemble of decision trees
  - [SVM](supervised/svm.md) - Support Vector Machines for classification and regression
  - [XGBoost](supervised/xgboost.md) - Gradient boosting implementation

- [**Unsupervised Learning**](unsupervised/) - Algorithms that find patterns in unlabeled data
  - [K-means](unsupervised/kmeans.md) - Centroid-based clustering
  - [DBSCAN](unsupervised/dbscan.md) - Density-based clustering
  - [PCA](unsupervised/pca.md) - Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction

- [**Semi-Supervised Learning**](semi_supervised/) - Algorithms that use both labeled and unlabeled data
  - [Label Propagation](semi_supervised/label_propagation.md) - Graph-based label propagation
  - [Semi-Supervised SVM](semi_supervised/semi_supervised_svm.md) - SVM with unlabeled data

## Machine Learning Workflow

For a complete overview of the machine learning workflow, see [ml_workflow.md](../ml_workflow.md).

## Implementation Details

Each algorithm documentation includes:
- Overview and principles
- Advantages and limitations
- Implementation examples
- Hyperparameter descriptions
- Use cases
- References

## Getting Started

Start with [Decision Trees](supervised/decision_trees.md) for a good introduction to our documentation structure and implementation approach.
