## Current Blockers and Next Actions

### 🚫 Critical Blockers

1. **No Datasets**: Need to collect and organize sample datasets
2. **No Data Processing**: Need basic data loading and preprocessing utilities

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Data Collection** (High Priority - Week 1)
   ```bash
   # Create data collection script
   scripts/collect_sample_datasets.py

   # Target datasets:
   - Iris dataset (classification)
   - Wine dataset (classification)
   - California housing (regression)
   - Mall customers (clustering)
   ```

2. **Basic Data Processing** (High Priority - Week 1)
   ```bash
   # Implement core utilities
   src/machine_learning_model/data/
   ├── loaders.py      # Dataset loading utilities
   ├── preprocessors.py # Data cleaning and preprocessing
   └── validators.py   # Data quality validation
   ```

3. **First Algorithm Implementation** (Medium Priority - Week 2)
   ```bash
   # Start with simplest algorithm
   src/machine_learning_model/supervised/decision_tree.py
   notebooks/01_decision_tree_example.ipynb
   ```

### 📊 Progress Metrics

| Phase | Planned Duration | Actual Duration | Status | Completion |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | 2 weeks | 🔄 In Progress | 95% |
| Phase 2A | 2 weeks | - | ⏳ Blocked | 0% |
| Phase 2B | 2 weeks | - | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |
| Phase 2C | 2 weeks | - | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |
| Phase 3 | 2 weeks | - | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |

### 🏆 Key Achievements

1. **Robust Project Foundation**: Created a production-ready project structure
2. **Comprehensive Tooling**: All development tools and quality gates in place
3. **Excellent Documentation**: Thorough documentation for team collaboration
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment infrastructure
5. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized codebase following best practices

### 📈 Recommendations

#### To Accelerate Phase 2 Start

1. **Focus on Data First**:
   - Create `scripts/download_datasets.py`
   - Implement basic data loaders in `src/machine_learning_model/data/`

2. **Start Simple**:
   - Begin with Iris dataset and Decision Tree
   - Create first notebook: `notebooks/01_iris_decision_tree.ipynb`

3. **Parallel Development**:
   - While implementing algorithms, continue improving infrastructure
   - Add algorithm-specific documentation as we build

#### Success Criteria for Phase 1 Completion (100%)

- [x] Project structure complete ✅
- [x] Development environment ready ✅
- [x] Documentation framework complete ✅
- [x] Sample datasets downloaded and organized ✅
- [ ] Basic data loading utilities implemented ⏳

**Estimated Time to Phase 1 Completion**: 4-6 hours (just preprocessing utilities)

**Estimated Time to Phase 2A Start**: 1 day (after basic utilities)
