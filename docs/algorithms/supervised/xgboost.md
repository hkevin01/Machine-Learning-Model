# XGBoost

## Overview

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized gradient boosting library designed for efficiency, flexibility, and portability. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework, creating an ensemble of weak prediction models to produce a strong predictor.

## Principles

XGBoost operates on these key principles:

1. **Gradient Boosting**: Builds trees sequentially, with each new tree correcting errors of the previous ensemble
2. **Regularization**: Includes L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
3. **Weighted Quantile Sketch**: For efficient computation of split points
4. **Sparsity Awareness**: Handles missing values automatically
5. **Cache Awareness**: Optimizes memory usage for faster computation

## Advantages

- Superior performance on tabular data
- Built-in handling of missing values
- Regularization for better generalization
- Efficient memory usage and computation
- Support for parallel and distributed computing
- Built-in cross-validation

## Limitations

- Less effective for unstructured data (images, text) compared to deep learning
- More hyperparameters to tune than simpler models
- Can overfit if not properly regularized
- Requires more memory than simpler models
- Less interpretable than single decision trees

## Implementation

Our implementation provides a clean interface to the XGBoost library:

```python
from machine_learning_model.supervised.xgboost_model import XGBoostClassifier, XGBoostRegressor

# Classification example
clf = XGBoostClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3
)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = clf.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# Regression example
regressor = XGBoostRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3
)
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = regressor.predict(X_test)
mse = regressor.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# Feature importance
importances = clf.feature_importances_
```

| `n_estimators`     | Number of boosting rounds                                   | `100`   |
| `learning_rate`    | Step size shrinkage to prevent overfitting                  | `0.1`   |
| `max_depth`        | Maximum depth of a tree                                     | `3`     |

| `colsample_bytree` | Subsample ratio of columns for each tree                    | `1.0`   |
| `gamma`            | Minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition | `0`     |
| `reg_alpha`        | L1 regularization term on weights                           | `0`     |

## Early Stopping

XGBoost supports early stopping to prevent overfitting:

```python
clf.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
    early_stopping_rounds=10,
    verbose=True
)
```
