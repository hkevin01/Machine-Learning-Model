## Current Blockers and Next Actions

### 🚫 Critical Blockers

1. **No Datasets**: Need to collect and organize sample datasets
2. **No Data Processing**: Need basic data loading and preprocessing utilities

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Data Collection** (High Priority - Week 1)
   ```bash
   # Create data collection script
   scripts/collect_sample_datasets.py

   # Target datasets:
   - Iris dataset (classification)
   - Wine dataset (classification)
   - California housing (regression)
   - Mall customers (clustering)
   ```

2. **Basic Data Processing** (High Priority - Week 1)
   ```bash
   # Implement core utilities
   src/machine_learning_model/data/
   ├── loaders.py      # Dataset loading utilities
   ├── preprocessors.py # Data cleaning and preprocessing
   └── validators.py   # Data quality validation
   ```

3. **First Algorithm Implementation** (Medium Priority - Week 2)
   ```bash
   # Start with simplest algorithm
   src/machine_learning_model/supervised/decision_tree.py
   notebooks/01_decision_tree_example.ipynb
   ```
